# VisionAID

## What is VisionAID?

**VisionAID** is an assistive technology project designed to support blind and visually impaired people during everyday mobility.

At its core, VisionAID uses **computer vision and on-device artificial intelligence** to analyze, in real time, the images captured by a camera and identify potential dangers in the surrounding environment—such as approaching vehicles or other moving objects.

When a risk is detected, the system immediately notifies the user through **audio cues and haptic feedback**, enabling faster reactions and safer movement.

## How It Works

VisionAID is built around two tightly connected components:

* A **mobile application** (Android & iOS)
* A **standalone physical device** equipped with its own camera and processing unit

Both components perform **on-device image processing**, avoiding cloud dependency and ensuring:

* Low latency
* Offline usability
* Greater privacy

The physical device can operate autonomously, while also communicating with the mobile app to share data and statistics that help analyze usage patterns and system effectiveness.

## Key Features

* Real-time detection of moving objects and approaching hazards
* Audio feedback optimized for accessibility
* Haptic alerts for immediate, non-visual warnings
* On-device AI inference for fast and reliable responses
* Cross-platform mobile support (Android and iOS)
* Integration with a dedicated hardware device
* Collection and visualization of usage statistics

## Target Users

VisionAID is designed for:

* Blind users
* People with partial or severe visual impairments

The system aims to enhance personal autonomy, confidence, and safety in daily environments such as streets, sidewalks, and public spaces.

## Technology Overview

The project leverages modern mobile and AI technologies, including:

* **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile development
* **On-device machine learning models** for real-time image analysis
* **TensorFlow Lite**, **ML Kit**, and **YOLO-based models** for object and motion detection
* **Wireless communication** between the mobile app and the physical device

The focus is on efficiency, responsiveness, and accessibility-first design.

## Accessibility by Design

Accessibility is a core principle of VisionAID:

* No reliance on visual-only interfaces
* Clear and customizable audio feedback
* Immediate tactile responses for critical situations
* Simple interaction model suitable for non-visual use

The goal is to create a tool that seamlessly integrates into the user's routine without adding cognitive or operational complexity.
