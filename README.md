# VisionAID

VisionAID is an assistive technology project designed to support blind and visually impaired people during everyday mobility.

It uses AI to analyze the images captured by the phone camera and and identify potential dangers in the enviroment, such as approaching vehicles or other obstacles.

When a risk is detected, the user is notified through audio cues and haptic feedback.
## How it works

The project is built around two components:

- VisionAID mobile application
- A standalone physical device that can operate autonomously while also communicating with the mobile app to share data and statistics.

Both components perform on-device image processing, ensuring:
- Low latency
- Offline usability
- Greater privacy
